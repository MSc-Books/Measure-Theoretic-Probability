\chapter{Introduction to $\sigma$-algebra}

From the classical probability, we encountered \textit{Bertnard's Paradox}, which highlighted the significance of rotational and translational invariance in probability measurements. We discovered that probabilities, much like lengths, areas, or volumes, should remain unchanged when subjected to such transformations. For example, if two points are separated by a distance $d$, shifting them by an equal amount in the same direction preserves that distance. This invariance hints that probability is not merely a tool for quantifying uncertainty but rather a form of measure - just like length, area or volume. \\

This realization serves as our starting point for a deeper, more formal approach to understanding probability, known as \textbf{Measure Theoretic Probability}. By treating probability as a measure, we establish a rigorous mathematical foundation that allows us to precisely define, manipulate, and compute probabilities, even in complex scenarios involving infinite spaces or continuous distributions. \\

In this chapter, we will build from the fundamentals of measure theory, gradually developing the key concepts required to form a robust understanding of probability in this framework \cite{probabilityfoundations}.
