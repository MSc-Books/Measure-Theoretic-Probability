\chapter{Random Variables}

The exploration of random variables arises from the observation that, in various situations, we may not be concerned with the specific basic outcome of a random experiment. Instead, we are often interested in some numerical function derived from that outcome.  For instance, consider an experiment where a coin is tossed ten times. Rather than focusing on the exact sequence of heads and tails that appears—such as heads, tails, heads, heads, tails, etc.—the experimenter might be primarily interested in the total count of heads obtained.\\

This shift in focus allows us to encapsulate the randomness of the experiment in a more manageable and meaningful way, as we transform the complexity of individual outcomes into a single number that conveys essential information about the experiment's result.
